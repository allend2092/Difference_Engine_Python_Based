# Difference Engine Simulation for Astronomical Calculations

## Introduction
This repository contains a Python implementation that simulates a Difference Engine, a concept envisioned by Charles Babbage in the early 19th century. The Difference Engine was designed to automate the calculation of mathematical tables, which were crucial for various scientific, engineering, and navigational purposes.

## About Charles Babbage and the Difference Engine
Charles Babbage was an English mathematician, philosopher, inventor, and mechanical engineer who is best known for conceptualizing the first automatic mechanical computer, the Difference Engine. The Difference Engine was intended to compute polynomial functions using the method of finite differences. Although Babbage never completed a fully functional Difference Engine, his work laid the foundation for future developments in computing.

## What This Code Does
This Python code simulates a Difference Engine to predict the positions of a celestial body (e.g., Mars) over a series of days based on initial position data. The code uses the initial positions for the first few days and extrapolates the positions for the subsequent days using the method of finite differences.

## Astronomical Calculation Problem
### Problem Description
The goal is to calculate the position of a planet (Mars) over a series of days. We have the initial position data for the first four days, and we want to predict the position for the next ten days.

### Initial Data
- Day 1: Position = 100 units
- Day 2: Position = 150 units
- Day 3: Position = 210 units
- Day 4: Position = 280 units

### Code Explanation
The code uses these initial values to build a difference table and then uses this table to predict the positions for the next ten days.

## Example:

initial_positions = [100, 150, 210, 280]

[100. 150. 210. 280. 360. 450. 550. 660. 780. 910.]

Process finished with exit code 0

Day 1: Position = 100 units (initial value)
Day 2: Position = 150 units (initial value)
Day 3: Position = 210 units (initial value)
Day 4: Position = 280 units (initial value)
Day 5: Position = 360 units (predicted value)
Day 6: Position = 450 units (predicted value)
Day 7: Position = 550 units (predicted value)
Day 8: Position = 660 units (predicted value)
Day 9: Position = 780 units (predicted value)
Day 10: Position = 910 units (predicted value)
